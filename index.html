                Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!

                Kif might! Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? You know, I was God once.
                
                My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
                I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!
                
                Your best is an idiot! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!
                
                Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.
                Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!
                I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!
